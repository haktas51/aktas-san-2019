This repositorty contains matlab source code and test files for related algorithm. 
User can download the source code and test files and then, automatically run the algorithm.
Using your test files(Multispectral Images and Shape files) by changing the user parameters you can easily use the algorithm.  
For detailed information about code and how to use the program user can have look user manual.
